## Introduction

<img src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="Photo" hspace="20" width="30%" align="right"/> Motivated by a strong interest in the intersection of **language and technology**, I have dedicated my academic and professional journey to linguistics and am now transitioning towards the exciting field of Natural Language Processing. The chance to utilise my solid background in linguistics in applied NLP is incredibly inspiring to me. My foundation in linguistics, coupled with my proven fast learning abilities demonstrated by my consistently high grades, are crucial assets in reaching my goal of making a significant contribution to the NLP field.
